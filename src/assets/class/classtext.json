	"Barbarian": "Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator's ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil.\n\n Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.",
